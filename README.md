# Hockey Player Analytics Report (Power BI)

This Power BI report was created as part of an assignment for the ENGETO Data Academy course. The objective was to analyze hockey player and league statistics using interactive visualizations and advanced Power BI features.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on data from [EliteProspects](https://www.eliteprospects.com/), a well-known hockey statistics portal. The main tables used for the report are:

- `player_dim.csv` – containing player dimension details
- `player_stats.csv` – containing detailed player statistics from various leagues and seasons

## What does this report analyze?

The report explores key metrics and trends in hockey player performance across different leagues, eras, and regions. Some of the main areas of focus include:

- **Top goal scorers and playmakers**: Ranking players by goals and assists to highlight outstanding individual performers.
- **Player age analysis**: Examining how player performance varies by age and across different seasons.
- **League comparison**: Comparing physical profiles (height, weight), player nationalities, and other metrics between European and North American leagues, as well as junior vs. senior leagues.
- **Shooting side statistics**: Distribution of left-handed vs. right-handed shooters.
- **Era-based trends**: Investigating how hockey has evolved over time, including changes in player physicality and international presence.

## Key insights & findings

During the analysis, several interesting observations emerged:

- Most top goal scorers and assist leaders come from North American leagues, primarily the NHL.
- There is a growing presence of international (non-North American) players in top leagues over recent decades.
- The average player height has gradually increased, suggesting a trend towards more physically robust athletes.
- The majority of players shoot left-handed, but the ratio varies across leagues and eras.
- Age has a noticeable impact on player performance, with peak productivity typically reached in the mid-20s.

## Report features

The Power BI report fulfills all main requirements of the assignment:

- **Multiple visual types**: At least five different visualization types are used (bar charts, line charts, pie charts, slicers, etc.).
- **Interactive filtering**: Slicers enable dynamic filtering by league, region, era, position, and more.
- **Bookmarks & navigation**: The report includes interactive buttons for page navigation and filter resets.
- **Data model relationships**: Two main tables are linked via player and league attributes, using Power BI relationships.
- **Calculated columns & measures**: Custom DAX columns and measures are created for advanced analysis (e.g., league type, region, top stats).
- **Hierarchies**: Multi-level hierarchy (e.g., era > season) is used for drill-down analysis.
- **Visual design**: Careful graphical adjustments ensure the report is user-friendly and visually appealing.
